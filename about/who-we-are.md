# Who We Are

This site was initially developed by the [Computational Acoustics special interest group (SIG-CA)](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) of the [UK Acoustics Network](https://acoustics.ac.uk/). At the time of writing, we are [Professor Nick Ovenden](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NCOVE55), [Dr Jonathan Hargreaves](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jonathan-hargreaves), [Dr Amelia Gully](https://ameliagully.com/) and [Dr Andrew Gibbs](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahagi/). You can contact us via [ukan.ca.knowledgebase@gmail.com](mailto:ukan.ca.knowledgebase@gmail.com).

We are grateful to all our contributors for their hard work on this site. Find out all about our contributors on our [Author Biolgraphies page](community/bios).
