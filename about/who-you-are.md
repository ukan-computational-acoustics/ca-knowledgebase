# Who this is for

We created the knowledgebase in response to concerns from both academia and industry that the learning curve of computational acoustics was often very steep, with (at least) three different elements:

* the algorithms themselves, and their theoretical bases
* implementation of the algorithm, including how to program it, navigating complicated user interfaces, and using software that may not be acoustics-specific
* computer science issues, such as how to use, maintain and share good quality code

This knowledgebase will be most useful to you if you have...

* some programming experience 
* a basic understanding of acoustics concepts (concepts specific to computational acoustics are covered in our [Core Concepts sections](../core-concepts/core-concepts-main))
* a specific acoustic problem or class of problems in mind

If you have any questions or comments, [get in touch](../community/discussion) and let us know!
