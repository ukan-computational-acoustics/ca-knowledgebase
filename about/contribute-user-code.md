# Add your own computational acoustics code

If you'd like to contribute to the community [user code database](https://knowledgebase.acoustics.ac.uk/user/user.html), please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1myQkqaE1XZ4Is2QjG_UUdrtwRAME4DAYu-w8knMzc14).
Your code will need to be hosted on GitHub, and we ask that you provide an informative readme file. You should also select a licence type.

If the sentence above makes sense to you, you don't need to read any further! If you would like to know *how* to create a GitHub repo for your code, read on...

## Hosting your code on GitHub

Before proceeding, you will need to [set up a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one already.

1. Log into GitHub.
2. At the top of the page, click **Repositories**. This will open a list of all your current repositories.
3. In the top right, click the green **New** button. This will open the *Create a new repository* page.
4. Input a name for your repository, and an optional description. Make the repository *public* (not private). Click the checkbox to **Add a README file** and make sure you **Choose a license** from the available list. Both a README and a license are requirements if you want to link to your code via the Computational Acoustics Knowledgebase.
5. Click **Create repository** at the bottom of the page.
6. You will now be taken to your repository page, and you will see at outline README file. You can click the pencil icon to edit the README file (using [markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)).
7. Use the **Add file** button at the top of the page to upload your code files or create new ones.
8. Once you are satisfied that your code is properly uploaded, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1myQkqaE1XZ4Is2QjG_UUdrtwRAME4DAYu-w8knMzc14) to submit it to us for inclusion in the knowledgebase.
