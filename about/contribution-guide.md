# Guide for Contributors

We are always seeking contributions and testers for all sections of the site.

To get an idea about what kind of things need doing, take a look at our
[list of open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ca-knowledgebase/ca-knowledgebase.github.io/issues).
If you think something not on that list needs doing, go ahead and [open an issue](https://github.com/ca-knowledgebase/ca-knowledgebase.github.io/issues/new).

We expect all contributors to the knowledgebase to follow the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

:::{note}
You must have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to make suggestions or contributions. Create one [here](https://github.com/signup). You can find a simple tutorial on using basic GitHub functionality [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
