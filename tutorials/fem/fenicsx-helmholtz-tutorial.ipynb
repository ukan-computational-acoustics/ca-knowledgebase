    "### The Governing PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Helmholtz Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The lossless wave equation reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 p = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p = p \\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ is the unknown pressure disturbance field, in Pascal. $p$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega} \\times T$ and has complex values. $c$ is the phase speed of sound in the medium, in meters per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "We impose that the pressure field is a steady state harmonic field:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = \\tilde{p} \\exp\\left(j\\omega t\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $u$ is the unknown spatial part of the field. $u$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega}$ and has complex values. $j$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is the angular frequncy of the field, in radians per second. If $\\nu$ denotes the frequency in Hertz we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\omega = 2\\pi\\nu = kc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $k$ the wave number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting into the wave equation we obtain the Helmholtz equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 \\tilde{p} + k^2 \\tilde{p}  = 0\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "### The Weak Form\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to convert our PDE into a weak form to solve our problem with FEniCS. This is done by recognising that $u$ is a vector of an appropriate Sobolev space. Then, another test function $\\phi$ is taken from the Sobolev space, with the requirement of being $0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. Multiplication of the governing PDE with $\\phi$ and integration by parts lead to the weak form. The weak form reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\tilde{p}  \\cdot \\nabla \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} - k^2 \\int_\\Omega \\tilde{p}  \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\\int_{\\partial \\Omega_l} g_l \\phi^\\star ds\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we simplified notation by dropping the functions arguments. $d\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the volume element of $\\Omega$ while $ds$ denotes the surface element in $\\partial \\Omega$. $\\star$ denotes complex conjugation. Note that the equation above has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\left(u,\\phi\\right) = L\\left(\\phi\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a$ and $L$ are the bilinear and linear form respectively. FEniCS requires the specification of these two quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The Neumann boundary conditions feature directly in the weak form. The same goes for Robin conditions. However, Dirchlet boundary conditions don't and are treated separately.\n",

Through meshing we simplify this space to one that has _finite dimension_. This also transforms the integrals of the weak form in sums, which are then expressed as matrix-vector operations. We do not need to worry about these details: we specify the mesh and FEniCS will take care of the rest.\n",
