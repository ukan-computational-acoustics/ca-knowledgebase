    "Where $p = p \\left(\\mathbf{x},t\\right)$ is the unknown pressure disturbance field, in Pascal. $p$ is defined in $\\overline{\\Omega} \\times T$ and has complex values. $c$ is the phase speed of sound in the medium, in meters per second.\n",

    "### The Weak Form\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to convert our PDE into a weak form to solve our problem with FEniCS. This is done by recognising that $u$ is a vector of an appropriate Sobolev space. Then, another test function $\\phi$ is taken from the Sobolev space, with the requirement of being $0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. Multiplication of the governing PDE with $\\phi$ and integration by parts lead to the weak form. The weak form reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\tilde{p}  \\cdot \\nabla \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} - k^2 \\int_\\Omega \\tilde{p}  \\phi^\\star d\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\\int_{\\partial \\Omega_l} g_l \\phi^\\star ds\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we simplified notation by dropping the functions arguments. $d\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the volume element of $\\Omega$ while $ds$ denotes the surface element in $\\partial \\Omega$. $\\star$ denotes complex conjugation. Note that the equation above has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\left(u,\\phi\\right) = L\\left(\\phi\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a$ and $L$ are the bilinear and linear form respectively. FEniCS requires the specification of these two quantities.\n",
    "\n",

Through meshing we simplify this space to one that has _finite dimension_. This also transforms the integrals of the weak form in sums, which are then expressed as matrix-vector operations. We do not need to worry about these details: we specify the mesh and FEniCS will take care of the rest.\n",
