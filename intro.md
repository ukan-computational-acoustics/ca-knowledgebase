How to use this site:

- Use the **core concepts** sections to learn about the underlying concepts that make computational acoustics possible.
- Use the **tutorials** to explore real computational acoustics code with detailed explanations. 
- Use the **software guides** for help with common computational acoustics software packages, both commercial and open source.
- Browse the **user-submitted code** section to explore computational acoustics code submitted by our users.
- You can download book pages and code by clicking the download logo ( <i class="fas fa-download"></i> ) at the top of the page.
- Wherever you see the rocket logo ( <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> ) at the top of the page, you can run that code directly in your browser by clicking on the logo and selecting "Binder".
