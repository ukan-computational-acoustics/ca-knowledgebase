Amelia Gully is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Language and
Linguistic Science at the University of York. Her work focuses on the acoustics of speech, and
particularly how someone's vocal anatomy contributes to the uniqueness of their voice. She is
a member of the [UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest
Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee.

## Jonathan Hargreaves

Jonathan Hargreaves is a Lecturer in Acoustic and Audio Engineering at the University of
Salford. Most of his research focuses on computational acoustics algorithms, but he also has
strong interests in loudspeaker arrays, material characterisation, and microphone arrays. He
teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses on computational acoustics and is especially
passionate about communicating its core concepts in accessible ways. Jonathan was awarded the
UK Institute of Acoustics' Tyndall Medal for outstanding contribution to acoustics research
and education in September 2016. He is a member of the
[UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee,
the [EAA Technical Committee for Computational Acoustics](https://euracoustics.org/technical-committees/computational-acoustics/),
and the IOA Research Coordination Committee.

Nick Ovenden is a Professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London. He currently
works on wave propagation in complex media, particulary media containing contrast agents such
as coated microbubbles. Other research interests include outdoor sound propagation, biomedical
applications and physiological modelling. He co-leads the
[UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/).
