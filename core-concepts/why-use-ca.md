This page will describe two main benefits:
* Accelerated prototyping cycles for design
* Additional insight that would be challenging to measure



## Product Design Cycles

### Traditional Physical Product Design Cycles

## Additional insight that would be challenging to measure
This example considers a Chladni plate.
