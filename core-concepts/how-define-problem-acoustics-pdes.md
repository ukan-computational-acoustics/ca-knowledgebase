This page will define concretely (i.e. in maths), the acoustics PDEs and boundary conditions that we will focus upon in this knowledgebase

PDEs
* Wave Equation
* Helmholtz Equation (insert complex time-harmonic assumption) [link for background on complex time-harmonic signals](https://youtu.be/tBk-sDXRCQ8)

BCs:
* Neumann
* Dirichlet
* Impedance / Admittance / Robin
* Continuity coupling e.g. to FEM
