This page will discuss the differences between geometry and a mesh
It will also signpost the sub-pages.


## Geometry
* Exact definition of geometry (correct curvature etc.)
* Surface sections can be large w.r.t. wavelength

## Mesh
* Approximate version of geometry
  * nodes ‘sampled’ from geometry then curvature of elements is interpolated
* Elements should be small w.r.t. wavelength

```{note}
I have some cateye geometries & meshes created in Gmsh if we prefer to avoid COMSOL ones?
