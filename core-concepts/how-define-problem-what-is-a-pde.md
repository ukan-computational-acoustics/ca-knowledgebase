This page will talk through what a PDE is, either via a couple of very simple examples or some external links.
Mass on a spring is the classic one to discuss but there are others.
Riding a bike or driving a car? Just got input force, inertia and drag then - not stiffness. Would lead to point that PDEs have to 2nd order to be oscillatory, if that's something we want to get into.
